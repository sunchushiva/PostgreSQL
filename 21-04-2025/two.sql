## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement #2: Freelance Marketplace**

A platform connects freelancers with clients who post projects. Freelancers can browse available projects, submit proposals, get hired, and complete milestones. Clients can review freelancers after work completion.


### ðŸ§© Business Logic & Constraints

- Freelancers and clients both register on the platform with a unique email and a password (minimum 8 characters, must contain upper, lower, number).
  
- Every project has:
  - A title, description, budget (greater than 100), and a status (`Open`, `In Progress`, `Completed`, `Cancelled`).
  - A project must be marked `Completed` **only if all its milestones are marked completed**.
  - A project can only be posted by a verified client.

- Milestones:
  - Each project contains one or more milestones, each having a title, amount, and a due date.
  - Milestone amounts must **sum up to less than or equal to the projectâ€™s budget**.
  - A milestone can be marked as `Pending`, `Submitted`, or `Completed`.

- Freelancers can:
  - Submit only **one proposal per project**.
  - Only submit proposals for `Open` projects.
  - A proposal includes a cover letter, expected bid, and proposed timeline.

- Once a proposal is accepted:
  - The project is marked as `In Progress`, and the freelancer becomes associated with the project.
  - No other proposals can be accepted for that project.

- Clients can:
  - Only review freelancers **after the project is completed**.
  - A review must include a star rating between 1 and 5 and an optional text comment.
  - One client can leave only **one review per freelancer per project**.

- The platform tracks:
  - When proposals are submitted and updated.
  - When milestones are created and marked completed.
  - When a review is submitted.
