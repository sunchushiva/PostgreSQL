/*
### ðŸ“¦ Problem Statement #1: *E-Learning Platform*

An e-learning platform allows instructors to create and publish courses. Each course contains multiple lessons. Students can register on the platform, enroll in courses, and track their progress. 

- Instructors must have a valid email and a short bio.
- Courses should have a title, description, price (non-zero), and a publish status (`Draft`, `Published`, `Archived`).
- A course cannot be published unless it contains at least one lesson.
- Lessons should have a title and a minimum duration of 1 minute.
- Students can enroll in multiple courses, but **cannot enroll in the same course more than once**.
- Students should not be allowed to mark lessons as completed unless theyâ€™re enrolled in the course that lesson belongs to.
- Course price is stored at the time of enrollment (for history, even if course price changes).
- All users (students or instructors) must have unique emails and strong passwords (at least 8 characters).
- The platform records timestamps when students enroll and when they complete a lesson.
